Experiment 1:
[Bart]
* exploratory experiment which gave that outflow valve is closed

Experiment 2:
[Bart]
* experiment that showed that you can add more data outputs to output file

Experiment 3:
[Bart]
* found out that pumps are different, but would like to have more data for pumps

Experiment 4:
[Elise] Valve positions experiment

Experiment 5:
[Bart] As experiment 3 showed: 2nd derivative was difficult to see, pumps are different,
so now different input signal and way more data will be generated. 
An FRF will be attempted too.
* ToRemoteLabs1-4 are specific input trajetories with stairs
* ToRemoteLabs4 was uploaded and tested, rest is smaller and not tested
* Toremotelabs5 is the input FRF data experiment

Experiment 6:
[Elise] Valve flow characteristics experiment

Experiment 7:
[Max] Try to get function block to work since for the MPC is was not working
result: matlab fcn block works. coder.extrincisc('....') works too. however, the moment when calling the function, for example 'ss', it gives errors
