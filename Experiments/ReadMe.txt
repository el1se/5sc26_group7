Experiment 3:
[Bart]

Experiment 4:
[Elise] Valve positions experiment

Experiment 5:
[Bart] As experiment 3 showed: 2nd derivative was difficult to see, pumps are different,
so now different input signal and way more data will be generated. 
An FRF will be attempted too.

Experiment 6:
[Elise] Valve flow characteristics experiment
