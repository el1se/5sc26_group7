Experiment 1:

Experiment 2:

Experiment 3:

Experiment 4:
Valve positions experiment

Experiment 5:
As experiment 3 showed: 2nd derivative was difficult to see, pumps are different,
so now different input signal and way more data will be generated. 
An FRF will be attempted too.

Experiment 6:
Valve flow characteristics experiment
